## Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account

In this workshop you will run Kubernetes in AWS. We have created a separate account for each student. You should receive an email with the credentials to log in.

We recommend using Google's Chrome browser during the workshop.

1. Go to <https://console.aws.amazon.com/>
1. Enter the username
1. Enter the user password

    > Note: Sometimes AWS asks for a verification code when it detects logins from unusual locations. It is a security measure to keep the account protected. If this happens, please ask the instructor for the verification code.

1. In the top right corner select the US East (N. Virginia) region.

## AWS Cloud9 Console

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) for managing cloud resources. Most of the exercises in this course are done from the command line, so you will need a terminal and an editor.

1. Visit https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/product?region=us-east-1
1. Click "Create Environment"
1. Name your environment "eks-workshop"
1. Click Next
1. Accept the defaults by clicking Next
1. Click "Create Environment"

You should eventually see something like this:
